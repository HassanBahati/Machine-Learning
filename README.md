# Machine learning fundamentals

## Milestones 
- Supervised learning algorithms
- Key concepts like under- and over-fitting, regularization, and cross-validation
- How to identify the type of problem to be solved, choose the right algorithm, tune parameters, and validate a model

## Introduction and exploratory analysis ([week-1]())
<b>Jupyter notebooks:</b> interactive coding and visualization of output.
<b>Numpy, SciPy, Pandas:</b> numerical computations
<b>Matplotlib, Seaborn:</b> data visualization
<b>Scikit-learn:</b> machine learning

<b>%matplotlib inline</b> displays plots inline in jupyter notebooks
<b>%timeit</b> how long a cell takes to execute
<b>%run filename.ipynb</b> execute code from another notebook or python file
<b>%load filename.py</b> copies contents from the file and pastes into the cell
